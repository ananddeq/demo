Let's look at a simple implementation of volumes. We have a single node Kubernetes cluster. 
We create a simple pod that generates a random number between one and hundred, and writes that with a 
file at /opt/number.out. It then gets deleted along with the random number. 
To retain the number generated by the pod, we create a volume. And a volume needs storage
